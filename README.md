# Temperature LED Indicator (Assembly)

This repository contains an assembly code implementation for a temperature LED indicator. The code allows users to input the current temperature and indicates the temperature range using different colored LEDs.

## Code Overview

The provided assembly code in `mp_proj.asm` performs the following tasks:

- Reads the current temperature input from the user.
- Compares the temperature value to predefined thresholds to determine the LED indicator color.
- Displays a corresponding message indicating the LED color (Red, Yellow, or Green) based on the temperature range.

## Usage

To use this code:

1. Assemble the `mp_proj.asm` code using an appropriate assembly compiler or assembler compatible with the target platform or microcontroller.
2. Load and run the resulting executable on a compatible platform or microcontroller that supports assembly language.
3. Follow the instructions prompted to enter the current temperature.
4. Observe the LED indicator color displayed based on the temperature range.

## Prerequisites

To run this code, you need:

- An assembly compiler or assembler compatible with the target platform or microcontroller.
- A platform or microcontroller capable of executing assembly code.
